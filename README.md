# Market Risk Analysis & VaR Modeling

## Project Overview
[cite_start]This repository contains the technical implementation of my research project, **"Analysis of market risk measurement techniques with focus on VaR"**, completed during my internship at the **Indian Bank Corporate Office (Risk Management Department)**.

The project focuses on calculating potential losses in financial portfolios by applying statistical models to historical price data.

## Core Methodologies
- [cite_start]**Parametric VaR (Variance-Covariance):** Uses the Z-score and normal distribution of log returns to quantify risk[cite: 8].
- [cite_start]**Historical Simulation:** A non-parametric method that determines the Value-at-Risk based on the actual distribution of historical returns[cite: 8].

## File Descriptions
- `risk_analysis.py`: The core engine containing the mathematical logic for VaR calculations.
- `market_data.xlsx`: The input dataset containing historical daily closing prices.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Financial Risk Management:** Understanding and calculating VaR at specific confidence intervals (95%/99%).
- **Technical Analysis:** Using Python (`Pandas`, `NumPy`, `SciPy`) to process financial time-series data.
- **Data Visualization:** Plotting return distributions and risk thresholds using `Matplotlib`.

## Internship Recognition
[cite_start]During this project at Indian Bank, I was recognized by the Assistant General Manager (HRD) for demonstrating **enthusiasm, leadership, self-discipline, and self-motivation**[cite: 9, 13].
